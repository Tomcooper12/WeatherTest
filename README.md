# Weather Test

Given more time I would have written this in a TDD manner and / or completed more tests.

The API's could have been queried with AJAX from the UI, however I felt given the role I should do this server side.

I would also make the following changes:

* Update the service to return results in both units of measure, this would ensure users can switch results in the UI more efficiently.
* Implement a data layer per API using a common interface and this would allow each service to be tested individually.
